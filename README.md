# Zoidberg2.0 Computer-Aided Diagnosis

## Project Description:

Zoidberg2.0 Computer-Aided Diagnosis is a machine learning project developed during my first year of Master of Science at EPITECH.

Its primary objective is to aid medical professionals in identifying pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The project involves analyzing these medical images and categorizing them into three distinct classes:

- no pneumonia,
- viral pneumonia,
- bacterial pneumonia.

The goal is to leverage Machine Learning to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support timely medical interventions.

## Key Features:

- **Data Collection:** The project leverages the ChestX-ray8 dataset, which includes a large collection of chest X-ray images along with metadata such as patient age, gender, and image characteristics.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Various machine learning algorithms are employed to develop accurate classification models. These models are trained using a combination of supervised learning techniques and deep neural networks.
- **Evaluation and Optimization:** The performance of the models is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. Hyperparameter tuning techniques are applied to optimize model performance.
- **Technical Documentation:** The project includes technical documentation in the form of Jupyter notebooks and a synthesis document (PDF) summarizing the results and findings.
